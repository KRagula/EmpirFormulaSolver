# Empirical Formula Solver

Project for IB Comp Sci IA 2016:
Solving Empirical Formulas.  This program will take in the values of percents of atoms in an unknown molecule, calculate the amount of each atom in the molecule, and then return the Empirical Formula of the molecule.
<br /> 
Currently, I will be using an enum for the elements (as there is sadly not an import package for the Periodic Table) and I will be working on populating this unless I can find an alternative.

This will be displayed using Swing.  All numbers will be estimates to the best the program can do.
